//It's Chef's birthday month and so she has decided to organize a big sale in which grand discounts will be provided.//

//In this sale, suppose a recipe should have a discount of x percent and its original price (before the sale) is p. Statistics says that when people see a discount offered over a product, they are more likely to buy it. Therefore, Chef decides to first increase the price of this recipe by x% (from p) and then offer a discount of x% to people.//
